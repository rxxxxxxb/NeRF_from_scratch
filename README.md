# NeRF from scratch: Minimal Working Example

This repo contains minimal, self-contained PyTorch implementation of NeRF that demonstrates the core NeRF concepts on the Blender 'ficus' dataset. 
This is inspired by the [TinyNeRF tutorial](https://github.com/bmild/nerf/tree/master) and is ideal for learning and experimentation.


The process will involve two main parts:

- Single-Image Training: We will first explore how NeRF works by training it on a single image.
- Multi-Image Training: We will subsequently extend the training to multiple images captured from multiple angles.
