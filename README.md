# NeRF from scratch: Minimal Working Example

This repo contains minimal, self-contained PyTorch implementation of NeRF that demonstrates the core NeRF concepts on the Blender 'ficus' dataset. 
This is inspired by the [TinyNeRF tutorial](https://github.com/bmild/nerf/tree/master) and is ideal for learning and experimentation.
